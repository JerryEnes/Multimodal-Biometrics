 ViT-WEF: Lightweight Vision Transformers with Adaptive Weighted Ensemble Fusion for Secure Multimodal Biometrics

This repository contains the official implementation of the ViT-WEF model proposed in the manuscript:

**"Enhancing Multimodal Biometrics with Lightweight Vision Transformers and Adaptive Ensemble Fusion"**

ViT-WEF integrates lightweight dual-stream ViT-Tiny encoders for iris and finger-vein recognition, using both **feature-level and score-level fusion**, followed by a **learnable weighted ensemble layer** to improve recognition accuracy in resource-constrained environments.

---

## ðŸ”¬ Overview

- **Modality 1:** Iris (CASIA-Iris-Thousand)
- **Modality 2:** Finger-Vein (FV-USM)
- **Fusion Strategy:** Dual-level (Feature + Score) with adaptive weighting
- **Backbone:** ViT-Tiny (12 transformer layers per modality)
- **Total Parameters:** ~11.4M
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 99.49% (on 492-class dataset)

## ðŸ§ª Setup Instructions

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Download datasets
CASIA-Iris-Thousand

FV-USM

3. Preprocess the datasets
bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocessing/iris_preprocess.py
